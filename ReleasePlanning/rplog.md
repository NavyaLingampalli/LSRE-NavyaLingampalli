Week 46:

 As a part of release planning assignment, I have referred to some of the articles

 [1] G. Ruhe and M. O. Saliu, “The art and science of software release planning,” IEEE Softw., vol. 22, no. 6, pp. 47–53, Nov. 2005.

[2]	P. Carlshamre, “Release planning in market-driven software product development: provoking an understanding,” Requir. Eng., vol. 7, no. 3, pp. 139–51, 2002.

These articles helped me to get an idea of release planning, its importance in the case of market driven requirements engineering and how it is implemented practically. Some of the approaches to develop a strategic release planning are also specified in these articles. 

Then I have gone through all the given 73 issues and tried to understand them. I felt that most of the basic requirements of course management system are covered and detailed and there are quite number of interdependencies among them.  

Week 47:

I have gone through all the issues in detail and identified some of the issues which are not clearly understood by me. To make them clear, I started commenting on the issues. 

Issue number: 35

Issue: Extra Contents of Personal Profile (The personal profile shall have the following text fields: address, zip code, city, e-mail address, ICQ UIN, home, mobile, and office phone number, fax number, age, interests, "about me", link to personal homepage)

Comment: Does the user need to provide all the details mentioned above compulsorily? All the users may not be willing to share their personal information. So it would be better if only important information is to be made compulsory and other contents are left optional to the user.

Issue number: 14

Issue: Course News (It shall be possible to attach news items to a course, in order to keep the students informed about the course).

Comment: What does the news item include? Does it include any additional links?

Issue number: 58

Issue: Access to use course file achieve (Participators in a course shall be able to browse the file archive and download files from the course file archive).

Comment: Is there any default location to save the downloaded files? It would be much easier for the participants if there is a feature of saving the files in desired location each time the download button is clicked.
Issue number: 21

Issue: Course Info (For each course, there shall be information attached containing scope and goal of the course, contents of the course, and examination forms in the course to present to the students what the course goals are).

Comment: It would be useful for the user if we add additional features like downloading the information such as examination forms.

Issue number: 6

Issue: Market (We are currently focusing on the Swedish market, but will extend this to the European market in the future. Long-term, we may wish to target other continents as well).

Comment: Educational systems may vary from continent to continent, so the present system may not be suitable and acceptable in other continents?
