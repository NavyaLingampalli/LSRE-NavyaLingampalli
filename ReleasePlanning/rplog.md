Week 46:

 As a part of release planning assignment, I have referred to some of the articles

 [1] G. Ruhe and M. O. Saliu, “The art and science of software release planning,” IEEE Softw., vol. 22, no. 6, pp. 47–53, Nov. 2005.

[2]	P. Carlshamre, “Release planning in market-driven software product development: provoking an understanding,” Requir. Eng., vol. 7, no. 3, pp. 139–51, 2002.

These articles helped me to get an idea of release planning, its importance in the case of market driven requirements engineering and how it is implemented practically. Some of the approaches to develop a strategic release planning are also specified in these articles. 

Then I have gone through all the given 73 issues and tried to understand them. I felt that most of the basic requirements of course management system are covered and detailed and there are quite number of interdependencies among them.
